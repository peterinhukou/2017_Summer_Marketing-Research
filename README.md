# 2017_Summer_Marketing-Research
My Marketing Research project. 
This includes Questionnaire design, the survey download from Qualtrics, the R code, and the report in Word and PPT. 
In this group project, I mainly setup the topic- preferences among Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, and Texas Rangers, and design most of the questions. Then my members put the questionnaire on Qualtrics, then we collect 83 responses most through our connections in Dallas area, then we do analysis by R or Excel, then we (mainly me and Alison Gordon) write the report in Word and PPT. Finally we present the PPT and upload the video on YouTube. 
This project was graded by Professor BPS Murthi and we got 92.
